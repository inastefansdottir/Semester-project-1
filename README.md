# Community Science Museum
## Project Overview

This project involved designing and developing a website for the Community Science Museum using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a responsive, accessible, and engaging site for children and families, providing them with interactive exhibitions on topics such as biology, medicine, cosmology, and evolution.

## Design and Development Process

### Design Phase

• I began by researching similar websites to gather inspiration and keep the layout simple and user-friendly. I focused on a vibrant color palette of orange, red, and light cream to appeal to children, with light blue used for hover effects.

• Wireframes were created for both desktop and mobile versions using Procreate on my iPad, with some adjustments made during the development phase.

• I incorporated fun shapes, gradients, and colors into the hero section and added color overlays to images to create a cohesive and playful design.

### Development Phase

• HTML content was organized with semantic tags like &lt;article&gt;, improving structure and accessibility.

• Initially, I experimented with CSS Grid, but switched to Flexbox for better responsiveness.

• Challenges arose when making the site responsive, particularly with navigation and a smooth sliding hamburger menu, but I was able to implement a functional solution.

### Testing and Challenges

• W3C Validator highlighted a few HTML errors, which were resolved by replacing &lt;section&gt; tags with &lt;div&gt; where necessary.

• On WAVE, contrast issues were identified. Although I made slight adjustments, I chose to retain the original vibrant color palette to maintain the playful design suitable for the target audience.

• Further refinement of aria-labels improved accessibility, and performance testing with Google Lighthouse showed that linking the global CSS file directly into the HTML improved website performance.

## Final Thoughts

While there were some limitations, including the inability to implement JavaScript functionality like a slider or functional search bar, the project allowed me to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, GitHub, and design principles. I am proud of the responsive design, especially the hamburger menu, and look forward to further refining my skills in future projects.
